# Project Title: Parallel Sorting Algorithms Implementation and Evaluation

## Overview
Welcome to our repository for the college project undertaken as part of the Algorithms Module. This project delves into the practical aspects of computer science research by focusing on the implementation and evaluation of parallel sorting algorithms. Each team was randomly assigned a research paper, and our team was tasked with studying and implementing the Parallel Quick Sort Algorithm (PQSA) and Merging Subarrays from Quick Sort Algorithm (MSQSA). 

## Project Description
The project aims to replicate and evaluate the performance of the proposed parallel sorting algorithms presented in the assigned research paper. Our ultimate goal is to compare our results with the benchmarks provided in the paper, particularly in terms of performance metrics against traditional serial sorting algorithms.

## Research Paper Abstract
The research paper assigned to our team discusses the inefficiencies of traditional serial sorting algorithms in utilizing the parallel computing capacity of modern computers. To address this issue, the paper introduces two parallel sorting algorithms: PQSA and MSQSA. These algorithms are designed to enhance the speed of sorting large-scale data, particularly in the context of the burgeoning field of data science. Experimental simulations demonstrate that both algorithms outperform traditional serial sorting algorithms, with PQSA and MSQSA exhibiting shorter running times and higher parallel speedups as the number of total threads increases. Notably, as the data size grows, MSQSA demonstrates slightly superior performance to PQSA, highlighting its practicality in handling massive datasets.

## Assignment Deliverables
